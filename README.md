# digitalSpirograph

My digital submission to Team Gaslight, using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap. Features canvas, for-loop, and array elements. Created from "scratch." Please play around with different colors, number of points, and degrees. I strongly suggest using odd numbers when you choose a degree. For example instead of using 180, try using 181 or 179 degrees. Instead of using 90 degrees, try using 91 or 89 degrees.
